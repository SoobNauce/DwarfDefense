### DwarfDefense ###
####################
A tower defense game written in Ruby

Basic Ideas:
	Idea:
		Tower Defense game inspired by dwarf fortress with autonomous 
	Summary:
		You start out with 7 dwarves on a flat plain in the middle of a field.  There is a wagon/store
		 thing in the middle that you can buy items and units from.  You get gold from killing the
		 incoming enemies.  Units increase in skill over time and foes become harder with time.

	Store:
		Buy Dwarves
			expensive
		Buy weapons/armor/ammo
			starting dwarves should be unequiped and unskilled
			upon buying weapons/armor/ammo at the store, unarmed dwarves will move from their
			 location to the store, pickup the proper equipment, and return to their post or
			 previous position
			items should have tiered qualities and attributes based on price
		Buy materials
			dwarves should be able to build walls and other structures around the map, but not
			 out of thin air.  Wood/Stone/Metals should be purchased at the store and hauled 
			 from there to the building site.
		
	Buildings
		Walls
			Materials matter only if we enable building destroyers
		Towers
			Build a tower that dwarves can run to the top of and fire crossbows from
			Humanoid enemies should have to break the tower door down (not the buildings hp) and
			 then fight the tower occupant in melee combat
		Ballista Towers
			Certain towers could have larger siege weapons which would have to be operated by 
			 dwarves.  Dwarves should be able to enter and leave at will
		Hospital
			Instead of dying for Dear Leader, we should be able to set a hp threshhold for a 
			 dwarf retreating to the hospital for healing
				This could be extended to dwarves needing sleep food and water and having
				 a day night cycle to model attrition during extended combat periods
			Could have dwarves recover wounded
	Dwarves
		Characteristics:
			Short sturdy creatures fond of drink and industry
			Beards
			Low center of gravity
			Strong arms
			resistant to damage
			needs alcohol to get through the working day
		Skills:
			Leveling up?
				manually stat choices? auto and/or manual?
				implement levels at all?
				
			Physical Attributes:
				Strength
				Speed
				Dexterity
				Vitality
				Flags:
					various perks from a bank of possible attribute effecting 
					 characteristics
			Combat Skills:
				Weapon Skills:
				Non-Weapon Attack Skills:
					punch
					kick
					shield bash
					shove
				Defense Skills
					block/parry/dodge stuff
			Abilities:(if implemented)
				maybe some cooldown actions that dwarves can get, buff, attack, etc...
			Building Skills:(if we want)
		
	Enemies
		Types
			Goblins
			Elves
			Humans
			Non-humanoids if feasible 
		Direction of attack
			Random placement around edge of map
			set direction
	
	UserInterface:
		Module:
			Rubygame?
			is there anything else worth looking at?
		Summary:
			grid map with sprite or ascii tilesets
			inputs and control to be determined
	

	Pathfinding
		Units need to be able to:
			Find a not retarded path to a destination
			Avoid Obstacles while pathing
			Chase a moving target
			Engage closest enemy if threatened
			
	
	Tasks/Jobs:
		Things need to be done like
			Manning a tower
			Standing guard
	                Building walls
	                Hauling materials to building site
	                returning to hospital for healing
	                Picking up equipment
	                targeting individual enemies
	                recovering wounded(if implemented
                These tasks should operate in a queue fashion with certain jobs having priority
                 over others.  If this seems sketch then we can specify a specific builder dwarf or
                 medic dwarf for not combat tasks
		There should be a global list of jobs so the dwarves can autonomously carry out order once
		 without micromanagment
	
	Combat:
		Damage
		Accuracy
		Setting equipment attributes
		types of attacks
		readiness
		fatigue/stamina?
		combat effectiveness
			scales with damage taken, fatigue, and readiness
			modifies damage, accuracy, and defense rolls
